	<p><blockquote align="justify">I am a college student with a broad range of abilities that I have honed over time. Time management, critical thinking, problem-solving, good communication, and research are a few of my strongest abilities. I've also had experience leading projects, making presentations in front of sizable crowds, and working in teams. These abilities are essential to both my academic and professional success, therefore I constantly work to get better at them. I have developed a range of skills both in and out of the classroom. In my academic pursuits, I have honed my research and analytical abilities, allowing me to delve deep into complex topics and draw meaningful conclusions. I am proficient in various software programs, including Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Suite, which I use to create visually appealing and effective presentations and reports. I am also an effective communicator, both verbally and in writing, and have honed my teamwork and leadership skills through group projects and extracurricular activities. In addition, I have experience in time management and prioritization, as I balance my academic responsibilities with my hobbies and other commitments.</blockquote></p>
  
  <h2><mark style="background-color:dbdbd7;color:171715;font-family:Georgia, Serif">HOBBIES</mark></h2>
	<p><blockquote align="justify">I take pleasure in participating in a number of hobbies that help me to unwind and recharge during my free time. Reading, participating in sports, traveling, and attempting new foods are some of my favorite pastimes. I also adore doing artistic things like drawing and taking pictures. My general pleasure and well-being depend on being able to explore my interests and use my imagination, which is made possible by my hobbies. Video gaming is one of my favorite hobbies, as it allows me to unwind and immerse myself in virtual worlds. I enjoy playing a variety of genres, including first-person shooters, role-playing games, and strategy games. Gaming also provides me with opportunities to connect with others, whether through online multiplayer or local LAN parties. In addition to gaming, I enjoy reading, hiking, and practicing photography. Reading allows me to explore new worlds and perspectives, while hiking and photography allow me to disconnect from technology and connect with the beauty of the natural world.</blockquote></p>

  <h2><mark style="background-color:dbdbd7;color:171715;font-family:Georgia, Serif">INTERESTS</mark></h2>
	<p><blockquote align="justify">Although my interests are many and constantly changing, some of my current loves are technology, foreign cultures, and environmental sustainability. In these areas, I am constantly looking for new information and experiences, and I enjoy sharing my views and opinions with people. I am continuously pursuing new interests, whether it be through involvement in student organizations, going to lectures and events, or just having conversations. As a college student, I am passionate about learning and exploring new subjects. I am particularly interested in psychology and human behavior, as well as environmental science and sustainability. In my psychology courses, I have learned about the workings of the human mind and the factors that influence behavior, which has allowed me to better understand myself and others. In my environmental science courses, I have learned about the impact of human activity on the planet and the importance of sustainability in preserving our natural resources. I am also interested in technology and its impact on society, as well as the intersection of art and technology. In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date on the latest developments in these fields through podcasts, documentaries, and online communities.</blockquote></p>
